# Readme Tasks 1-3 - Unit tests



## Usage
* Every task is numbered in comment before func definition
* There are unit tests written for every task
* TO start unit test write in terminal: pytest main.py
* For 2nd task there is only 1 unit test. File system on every PC is different so results would be different. I tested it in League of Legends folder which contained those exec files:
* 23631376b
* C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\LeagueClient.exe
* 3692048b
* C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\LeagueClientUx.exe
* File: C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\LeagueClientUx.exe
* 2845712b
* C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\LeagueClientUxRender.exe
* File: C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\LeagueClientUxRender.exe
* 580624b
* C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\LeagueCrashHandler.exe
* File: C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\LeagueCrashHandler.exe
* So first file was too big and test result is second path which is correct with task criteria
    ```
